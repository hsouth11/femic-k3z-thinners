Scenario Comparison Guidance
----------------------------

Compare scenarios using consistent metrics and reporting windows:

- managed total/product yields,
- species-wise managed products,
- seral-stage area and treatment-shift trajectories,
- old-growth area trajectories from ``og1`` / ``og2``,
- key constraints/targets and infeasibility indicators.

Interpretation Workflow
-----------------------

1. Run baseline and variant scenarios with explicit run-ids.
2. Compare account trajectories period-by-period.
3. Flag differences caused by assumption changes vs data/build drift.

Optional CT/Fert Branch Guidance
--------------------------------

The CT/QMD/fert work is intentionally isolated as a variant spec/runtime/PIN set so only some student groups need to
pull it.

Recommended workflow:

1. Start from a clean, accepted ``main`` baseline.
2. If your group needs CT/fert, use the CT/fert variant spec and launch ``analysis/ctfert.pin``.
3. If your group needs the PCT->CT teaching scaffold, use the ``pctct`` variant spec and launch ``analysis/pctct.pin``.
4. Rebuild before interpreting any optional-variant surfaces.
5. Keep variant choice explicit in reports, screenshots, and classroom notes.
6. Use the overlay subvariants only when the question is about retained-area
   sensitivity on top of baseline.

Classroom Use Guidance
----------------------

- Start from reproducible baseline before exploring policy changes.
- Change one assumption family at a time when teaching sensitivity.
- Preserve run manifests/reports for each scenario to support auditability.
- Treat the optional CT/fert variant as a teaching/scenario scaffold, not a
  polished silviculture prescription package.

How to Validate Reruns
----------------------

1. Confirm matrix-build manifest success.
2. Confirm rebuild report invariants pass.
3. Confirm scenario deltas are explainable by intentional config edits.
4. On the optional variant, confirm compiled tracks and live Patchworks behavior
   agree about the ``CT`` -> ``F1`` -> ``F2`` -> ``F3`` chain.
5. On the ``pctct`` variant, confirm compiled tracks and live Patchworks
   behavior agree about the ``PCT`` -> ``CT`` -> ``CC`` chain.
6. On overlay subvariants, confirm the only intended behavioral change is the
   managed-vs-unmanaged split driven by fragment ``RETENTION``.

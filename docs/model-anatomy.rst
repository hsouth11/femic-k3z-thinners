Generated vs Editable
---------------------

Safe to edit directly:

- ``config/run_profile.k3z.yaml``
- ``config/seral.k3z.yaml``
- ``config/tipsy/tsak3z.yaml``
- ``config/silviculture.k3z.base.yaml`` for optional baseline harvested-QMD
  support-surface switches
- ``config/silviculture.k3z.ctfert_l15h5.yaml`` for the optional CT/fert
  ``L15/M10/H5`` subvariant
- ``config/silviculture.k3z.ctfert_l20h0.yaml`` for the optional CT/fert
  ``L20/M10/H0`` subvariant
- ``config/silviculture.k3z.pct_light.yaml`` for the optional light PCT-only subvariant
- ``config/silviculture.k3z.pct_moderate.yaml`` for the optional moderate PCT-only subvariant
- ``config/silviculture.k3z.pct_heavy.yaml`` for the optional heavy PCT-only subvariant
- fragment-level ``RETENTION`` values when/if you intentionally edit retained-area policy in the validated fragments dataset

Regenerate instead of hand-edit:

- ``data/model_input_bundle/*.csv``
- ``models/k3z_patchworks_model/tracks/*.csv``
- ``models/k3z_patchworks_model/yield/forestmodel.xml``
- ``output/patchworks_k3z_validated/fragments/*``

Use caution:

- ``models/k3z_patchworks_model/analysis/base.pin`` (runtime wiring)
- ``models/k3z_patchworks_model/blocks/*`` (must stay join-consistent with tracks)

Core Feature and Product Surfaces
---------------------------------

Seral account surfaces:

- Global compatibility surface: ``feature.Seral.<stage>``
- AU-specific inventory-state surface: ``feature.Seral.<au_token>.<stage>``
- Treatment consequence surface: ``product.Seral.area.<stage>.<au_token>.CC``

Old-growth surfaces:

- ``feature.Area.og1.<au_token>``
- ``feature.Area.og2.<au_token>``
- ``feature.Area.og1.total``
- ``feature.Area.og2.total``

Current old-growth curve semantics:

- ``og1``: unmanaged-curve-driven ramp from CMAI age (0.0) to unmanaged
  peak-yield age (1.0)
- ``og2``: policy-step curve with ``249 -> 0.0`` and ``250 -> 1.0``

Deep reference: :doc:`old-growth-attributes`

These are inventory-state feature surfaces, not treatment-consequence products.
They should appear automatically in compiled Patchworks accounts after Matrix
Builder regenerates ``protoaccounts.csv`` / ``accounts.csv``.

Baseline and Overlay Harvested-QMD Surface
------------------------------------------

The accepted K3Z baseline and the four baseline-derived overlay subvariants
now also carry an AU-wise harvested-stem QMD account contract for ``CC``.

Additional baseline/overlay support surfaces:

- standing-stock approximate QMD outputs:
  - ``feature.QMD.managed.<au_token>``
  - ``feature.QMD.unmanaged.<au_token>``
- harvested-QMD numerator attributes:
  - ``product.QMDNumerator.managed.<au_token>.CC``
- matching denominator attributes:
  - ``product.Treated.managed.<au_token>.CC``

The shipped XML/tracks define those numerator and denominator attributes. At
launch time, ``analysis/base.pin`` and the overlay PIN family source the common
ratio-account helper so Patchworks registers live:

- ``product.QMD.managed.<au_token>.CC``

Those live ratio accounts divide the matching
``product.QMDNumerator.managed.<au_token>.CC`` account by the corresponding
``product.Treated.managed.<au_token>.CC`` account with scale ``1``, so the
live values resolve directly to mean harvested-stem diameter in ``cm``.

These baseline and overlay launch surfaces also apply a downstream recovered-
volume utilization assumption during ``protoaccounts.csv -> accounts.csv``
promotion:

- ``CC`` harvested volume uses utilization ``0.85``
- ``CT`` harvested volume uses utilization ``0.75`` on CT-enabled variants

That policy lives in the runtime config layer, not in the ForestModel XML. The
standing yield curves remain unchanged; only the promoted harvested-volume
accounts are scaled to represent recovered merchantable volume.

Retention Surface
-----------------

K3Z carries a fragment-level ``RETENTION`` field in the validated Patchworks
fragments dataset.

- ``0.0`` means no retained area is withdrawn from the managed landbase.
- ``1.0`` means the full fragment area is retained.
- intermediate values mean partial retained area.

Current K3Z baseline:

- the teaching baseline on ``main`` uses ``RETENTION = 0.05`` for all fragments
- retained area is therefore withdrawn from the managed landbase and compiled
  into unmanaged area/tracks/accounts in Patchworks

Do not hand-edit retention in multiple places. If you change retention policy,
update the validated fragments dataset and rerun Matrix Builder so the retained
share flows into Patchworks unmanaged area consistently.

Optional CT/Fert Variant Surface
--------------------------------

The optional CT/fert variant adds a second layer
of model anatomy that is intentionally not part of the baseline K3Z teaching
instance on ``main``.

Additional state/config artifacts for that variant:

- fragment/XML state field: ``SILV_STATE``
- silviculture configs for the shipped CT/fert SI-profile subvariants:
  - ``config/silviculture.k3z.ctfert_l15h5.yaml``
  - ``config/silviculture.k3z.ctfert_l20h0.yaml``
- approximate QMD outputs:
  - ``feature.QMD.managed.<au_token>``
  - ``feature.QMD.unmanaged.<au_token>``
  - harvested-QMD numerator attributes:
  - ``product.QMDNumerator.managed.<au_token>.CC``
  - ``product.QMDNumerator.managed.<au_token>.CT`` on the CT-eligible AU cohort
- treatment-path states:
  - ``baseline``
  - ``cc_pl``
  - ``cc_pl_ct``
  - ``cc_pl_ct_f1``
  - ``cc_pl_ct_f1_f2``
  - ``cc_pl_ct_f1_f2_f3``

Optional treatment surfaces for that variant:

- ``CT`` commercial thinning on the configured eligible AU cohort
- ``F1`` / ``F2`` / ``F3`` fertilization chain after CT
- matching compiled treatment products/accounts such as:
  - ``product.Treated.managed.CT``
  - ``product.Treated.managed.F1``
  - ``product.Treated.managed.F2``
  - ``product.Treated.managed.F3``
  - ``product.Treated.managed.<au_token>.CC``
  - ``product.Treated.managed.<au_token>.CT``

The shipped XML/tracks define AU-wise harvested-QMD numerator attributes plus
the matching treated-area denominator attributes. At launch time, the CT/fert
PIN files register live Patchworks ratio accounts:

- ``product.QMD.managed.<au_token>.CC``
- ``product.QMD.managed.<au_token>.CT``

Those runtime ratio accounts divide the matching
``product.QMDNumerator.managed.<au_token>.<treatment>`` account by the
corresponding ``product.Treated.managed.<au_token>.<treatment>`` account with
scale ``1``, so the live values resolve directly to mean harvested-stem
diameter in ``cm``.

The shipped CT/fert launch surfaces also apply the downstream recovered-volume
utilization policy during ``protoaccounts.csv -> accounts.csv`` promotion:

- ``CC`` harvested volume uses utilization ``0.85``
- ``CT`` harvested volume uses utilization ``0.75``

That policy does not alter standing yield curves or the ForestModel XML. It
only scales the promoted harvested-volume accounts so teaching runs reflect
recovered merchantable volume rather than perfect recovery.

The SI-profiled CT/fert subvariants extend that same state machine across the
six ``L/M/H`` SI-class ``CWHvm_FDC+HW`` / ``CWHvm_CW+HW`` AUs, but change the
fert response by SI class:

- ``ctfert_l15h5``: ``L=15%``, ``M=10%``, ``H=5%``
- ``ctfert_l20h0``: ``L=20%``, ``M=10%``, and no fert on ``H`` AUs

In this variant, ``ORIGIN`` still means natural vs planted. Treatment history is
carried by ``SILV_STATE`` instead of overloading ``ORIGIN``.


Optional PCT-Only Subvariant Family Surface
-------------------------------------------

The optional ``pct_light``, ``pct_moderate``, and ``pct_heavy``
subvariants add three coexisting upstream-distinct surfaces that keep the
baseline and CT/fert variants intact while inserting a pre-commercial-thinning
gate on the planted path.

Additional state/config artifacts for that variant:

- fragment/XML state field: ``SILV_STATE``
- silviculture configs:
  - ``config/silviculture.k3z.pct_light.yaml``
  - ``config/silviculture.k3z.pct_moderate.yaml``
  - ``config/silviculture.k3z.pct_heavy.yaml``
- treatment-path states:
  - ``baseline``
  - ``cc_pl``
  - ``cc_pl_pct``
- approximate QMD outputs:
  - ``feature.QMD.managed.<au_token>``
  - ``feature.QMD.unmanaged.<au_token>``

Optional treatment surfaces for that variant:

- ``PCT`` eligibility retargeted to medium/high SI ``HW+FDC`` and
  ``FDC+HW`` AUs ``985502000``, ``985503000``, ``985502001``, and
  ``985503001``
- three subvariant-specific age-10 PCT choices on the planted path:
  - ``pct_light`` -> remove ``1000`` HW stems/ha
  - ``pct_moderate`` -> remove ``2000`` HW stems/ha
  - ``pct_heavy`` -> remove ``3000`` HW stems/ha
- planted regen mix for those eligible AUs prepared as ``900 CW + 3100 HW``
- post-PCT managed mixtures of ``900 CW + 2100 HW``, ``900 CW + 1100 HW``, and
  ``900 CW + 100 HW`` respectively
- matching compiled treatment products/accounts such as:
  - ``product.Treated.managed.PCT``
  - ``product.Treated.managed.<au_token>.PCT``
  - ``product.Treated.managed.<au_token>.CC``
  - ``product.QMDNumerator.managed.<au_token>.PCT``
  - ``product.QMDNumerator.managed.<au_token>.CC``

The shipped XML/tracks define AU-wise harvested-QMD numerator attributes for
both ``PCT`` and the downstream planted-path ``CC`` treatment, plus the
matching AU-wise treated-area denominator attributes. At launch time, the
``pct_*`` PIN files register live Patchworks ratio accounts:

- ``product.QMD.managed.<au_token>.PCT``
- ``product.QMD.managed.<au_token>.CC``

Those runtime ratio accounts divide the matching
``product.QMDNumerator.managed.<au_token>.<treatment>`` account by the
corresponding ``product.Treated.managed.<au_token>.<treatment>`` account with
scale ``1``, so the live values resolve directly to mean harvested-stem
diameter in ``cm``.

The shipped ``pct_*`` launch surfaces inherit the same downstream recovered-
volume utilization policy during ``protoaccounts.csv -> accounts.csv``
promotion:

- ``CC`` harvested volume uses utilization ``0.85``
- ``CT`` would use utilization ``0.75`` if present, but the shipped
  ``pct_*`` family does not expose ``CT``

This variant is intended as a teaching scaffold for PCT intensity comparison
without the added complexity of CT or fertilization.

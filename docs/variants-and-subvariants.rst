Variants and Subvariants
========================

Purpose
-------

K3Z now ships as one instance checkout with one baseline surface, a small
family of coexisting CT/fert surfaces, a full-intensive teaching family,
three PCT-only teaching subvariants, and four baseline-derived overlay
subvariants.

Use this page as the canonical launch and interpretation map.

How to Choose a Surface
-----------------------

1. Start with ``base`` unless you explicitly need a treatment scaffold or an
   overlay sensitivity surface.
2. Choose ``ctfert_l15h5`` or ``ctfert_l20h0`` when the class exercise is
   about SI-specific fertilization response across the six ``L/M/H`` CT-eligible
   ``CWHvm_FDC+HW`` / ``CWHvm_CW+HW`` AUs.
3. Choose one of ``intensive_light``, ``intensive_moderate``, or
   ``intensive_heavy`` when the class exercise needs the full
   ``PCT -> CT -> F1 -> F2 -> F3`` scaffold on one launchable K3Z surface.
4. Choose one of ``pct_light``, ``pct_moderate``, or ``pct_heavy`` when
   the class exercise needs PCT intensity comparison without CT or fertilization.
5. Choose one of the four overlay subvariants only when the exercise is about
   alternative retained-area policy on top of the accepted baseline.

Overlay Provenance and Join Contract
------------------------------------

The four overlay subvariants are **subvariants of baseline**, not separate
top-level instance variants.

Current teaching handoff:

- student source is an abandoned GIS fork, represented in the current workflow
  by an attribute-table export named ``Fragments_Retention_HSmith.xls``;
- the workbook key field is ``FEATURE_ID1`` even though the canonical K3Z join
  uses ``FEATURE_ID``;
- the four retention columns are:
  - ``Basecase_Riparian``
  - ``BaseCase_Sum``
  - ``Scenario1_Sum``
  - ``Scenario2_Sum``

Bridge used in the current workflow:

1. Student workbook row keyed by ``FEATURE_ID1``.
2. Join to ``models/k3z_patchworks_model/blocks/blocks.shp`` on
   ``FEATURE_ID``.
3. Use block identity to reach the canonical fragments surface.
4. Write a normalized overlay table keyed to the canonical fragments.
5. Rebuild one fragments surface per selected retention column.

Operationally, the overlay subvariants should differ from baseline only by
fragment-level ``RETENTION`` values and the resulting managed-vs-unmanaged area
split.

Overlay Account-Surface Note
----------------------------

High-retention overlays can legitimately drop some species-wise managed
accounts.

That is not automatically a compile failure. If retained area removes a species
from the managed side of a subvariant, the corresponding managed species
account can disappear from that subvariant's compiled tracks and live Patchworks
account view.

For the repeatable student/operator workflow, use
:doc:`overlay-subvariants-workflow`.

Audit Checklist
---------------

- Keep the runtime config and PIN paired exactly as listed above.
- Compare overlay subvariants against ``base`` first, not against each other.
- Confirm the overlay source table still resolves 1:1 against the canonical
  fragments surface before interpreting results.
- Treat unexpected treatment-path changes on overlay subvariants as a bug,
  because overlays are intended to modify retained area only.
